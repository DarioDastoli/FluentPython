Fluent Python — Study Notes & Code Examples

This repository contains my personal notes, exercises, and code examples while studying **_Fluent Python_ by Luciano Ramalho**.  
The goal is to get a better comprehension of advanced python topics

Each chapter or topic from the book Fluent Python will have is own folder with:
- Example code files from the book
- Experiments or exercises
- Notes

I'll try to keep this repository updated each time i will work on it.
Since my main purpose is to go trhought all arguments of the book, i will primarily focus on understanding the content of each argument.
