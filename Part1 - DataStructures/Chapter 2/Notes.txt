Since i know that the tuples are immutable, i can define an order and work with the order of the items.

Like in the case of the example 2.7 --> city, year, pop, chg, area = ('Tokyo', 2003, 32_450, 0.66, 8014)

A tuple is immutable, but the referenced elements inside a tuple can change.

i can use hash bilt-in to create a function to check the mutability of the elements inside a tuple like in the file tuples.py


Tuples have some performance advantages over lists.

Tuples and list have the same api except for the __reversed__ method

The _ symbol is special in patterns: it matches the element that will be found in that position, but it will never be bound to that element. It also can appear more than once in a patterns

When destructuring i can bind any part of a pattern with a variable using 'as' kewyword
I can also add type information

* matches any number and type of items.
*extra binds all elements to extra while *_ does not bind them.




Avoid putting mutable items in tuples.
Augmented assignment is not an atomic operation
Inspecting Python bytecode is not too difficult, and can be helpful to see what is going on under the hood. 

functions or methods that change an object in place should return None to make it clear to the caller that the receiver was changed, 
and no new object was created.

The convention of returning None to signal in-place changes has a
drawback: we cannot cascade calls to those methods.
